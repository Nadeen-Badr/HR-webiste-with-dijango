                    <h2>Let’s talk about your risk.</h2>
                    <p>It can be tempting to try to skirt the labor laws in other countries by hiring contractors or otherwise deploying a workforce that might just slide under the radar of the local government. The costs are cheap and besides, you’re only testing the market anyway. You’ll get compliant when you have to. Right?</p>
                
                    <h2>Global HR Solutions to Manage Risk</h2>
                    <p>When you work with with Globalization Partners, the candidates you choose to hire walk and talk like your employees, but they’re actually on our payroll, thus forcing all the compliance risk on us. But don’t worry, we can handle it. We are a U.S.-headquartered company ourselves, and more than 25% of our non-sales and marketing staff are legally qualified as lawyers in the United States.</p>
